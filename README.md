# ZerliSystem
flower store system- mini project that was created in a group of five students. 

The system allows customers to view the catalog of the shop, purchase custome-made or previos-made items and complain.
It is also allows workers to view diffrent kinds of reports, answer complaints, approve orders and control other workers-
all according to different permission levels.

The communication between the client side and the server side was based on OCSF framework, the GUI was built using SceneBuilder
and the Database was made in MySQL.
